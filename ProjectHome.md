**Collection of PivotX Themes**

[PivotX](http://pivotx.net), also known as pivot 2, is nearing it's final state. The new version offers a real easy to use theming system. Unfortunately there are not so many PivotX themes. But there are many, many blogging themes available for other systems like Wordpress or MovableType.

As they are usually free to use, why not port them to PivotX.
